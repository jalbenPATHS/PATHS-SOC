<h1>Cloud Computing and Security</h1>

Students will be working towards CompTIA Cloud+ Certification

CompTIA Cloud+ reflects an emphasis on incorporating and managing cloud technologies as part of broader systems operations. It assumes a candidate will weave together solutions that meet specific business needs and work in a variety of different industries.

It includes new technologies to support the changing cloud market as more organizations depend on cloud-based technologies to run mission critical systems, now that hybrid and multi-cloud have become the norm.

The students will have access to Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS to run through lab activities.
