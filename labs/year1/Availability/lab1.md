Lab description: Students will either work alone or with a partner to simulate a DDoS attack on their pfSense firewall.  During the attack students will monitor system performance, check logs, and look at packet captures.  In the end students will research different steps to mitigate this attack with Next Gen Firewalls.

Standards: CompTIA IT Security+ 1.2 Compare and contrast types of attacks.<br>
CompTIA Security+ 3.2 Given a scenario, implement secure network architecture concepts.
