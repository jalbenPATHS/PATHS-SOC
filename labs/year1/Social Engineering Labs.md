<h1>Social Engineering Labs</h1>
Social Engineering labs will show the students common tools attackers will use to trick victims into given up credentials or access to systems.  There are not many labs listed here and hope it will change, most of our work with Social Engineering happens with our class discussions. One goal of the program is to include Phishing Simulation tests.
