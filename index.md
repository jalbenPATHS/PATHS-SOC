Integrity ensures that your information is accurate and has not been maniplulated.<br>

4.[Availability](/labs/year1/Availability Labs.md)<br>
Availability is keeping the information always accessible to the people who need to use it.<br>

5.[Social Engineering](/labs/year1/Social Engineering Labs.md)<br>
Social Engineering is the term we use for low tech attacks against people's weaknesses to gain access to information and resources.<br>

6.[Business Concepts](/labs/year1/Business Concepts Labs.md)<br>
